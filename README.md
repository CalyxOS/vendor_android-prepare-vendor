## Introduction
For the latest Android devices (Nexus and Pixel), Google is no longer providing
vendor binary archives to be included into AOSP build tree. Officially it is
claimed that all vendor proprietary blobs have been moved to `/vendor`
partition, which allegedly doesn't need building from users. Unfortunately, that
is not the case since quite a few proprietary executables, DSOs and APKs/JARs
located under `/system` are required in order to have a fully functional set of
images, although are missing from AOSP public tree. Additionally, if
`vendor.img` is not generated when `system.img` is prepared for build, a few
bits are broken that also require manual fixing (various symbolic links between
two partitions, bytecode product packages, vendor shared library dependencies,
etc.).

Everyone's hope is that Google **will revise** this policy for its devices.
However until then, missing blobs need to be manually extracted from factory
images, processed and included into AOSP tree. These processing steps are
evolving into a total nightmare considering that all recent factory images have
their bytecode (APKs, JARs) pre-optimized to reduce boot time and their original
`classes.dex` stripped to reduce disk size. As such, these missing prebuilt
components need to be repaired/de-optimized prior to be included, since AOSP
build is not capable to import pre-optimized bytecode modules as part of the
makefile tree.

Scripts & tools included in this repository aim to automate the extraction,
processing and generation of vendor specific data using factory images as
input. Data from vendor partition is mirrored to blob includes via a compatible
makefile structure, so that `vendor.img` can be generated from AOSP builds while
specially annotating the vendor APKs to maintain pre-signed certificates and not
pre-optimize. If you have modified the build process (such as CyanogenMod) you
might need to apply additional changes in device configurations / makefiles.

The main concept of this tool-set is to apply all required changes in vendor
makefiles leaving the AOSP source code tree & build chain untouched. Hacks in
AOSP tree, such as those applied by CyanogenMod, are painful to maintain and
very fragile.

Repository data is LICENSE free, use it as you want at your own risk. Feedback
& patches are more than welcome though.


### Status update (12 Feb 2017)
As of 7.1 release Google has started publishing again a set of vendor blobs for
supported Nexus & Pixel devices. Unfortunately the distributed blobs still miss
some functionality when compiled under AOSP:

* Vendor partition is distributed in a form that does not allow to enable
verified boot (dm-verity) against it
* Distributed blobs do not include APK bytecode vendor packages, only some jar
files. It is still unclear to what extent device functionalities are broken.
* Due to missing proprietary modules, required modules present in AOSP are not
included as active dependencies resulting into skipped functionality (e.g. IMS,
RCS).

### Status update (15 Sep 2017)
As of Oreo release (8.0) Google has improved the state of the proprietary vendor
blobs for Pixel devices. State of supported Nexus devices has not changed much.
For Pixel devices most vendor specific resources have been moved to vendor
partition and thus simplify & reduce the amount of work that needs to be done
to include /system dependencies. Furthermore, the original bytecode is no longer
stripped from the factory APKs, enabling an easier inclusion of these resources
to the generated vendor makefiles.


## Required steps summary
The process to extract and import vendor proprietary blobs requires to:

1. Obtain device matching factory images archive from Google developer website
(`scripts/download-nexus-image.sh`)
   * Users need to accept Google ToS for Nexus factory images
2. Extract images from archive, convert from sparse to raw, mount with ext4fuse
& extract data (`scripts/extract-factory-images.sh`)
   * All vendor partition data are mirrored in order to generate a production
   identical `vendor.img`
3. Repair bytecode (APKs/JARs) from factory system image (
`scripts/system-img-repair.sh`) using one of supported bytecode de-optimization
methods (see next paragraph for details)
4. Generate vendor proprietary includes & makefiles compatible with AOSP build
tree (`scripts/generate-vendor.sh`)
   * Extra care in Makefile rules to not break compatibility among supported
   AOSP branches

`execute-all.sh` runs all previous steps with required order. As an alternative
to download images from Google's website, script can also read factory images
from file-system location using the `-i|--img` flag.

`-k|--keep` flag can be used if you want to keep extracted intermediate files
for further investigation. Keep in mind that if used the mount-points from
ext4fuse are not unmounted. So be sure that you manually remove them (or run
the script again without the flag) when done.

All scripts can be executed from macOS, Linux & other Unix-based systems as long
as bash 4.x and other utilized command line tools are installed. Scripts will
abort if any of the required tools is missing from the host.

Scripts include individual usage info and additional flags that be used for
targeted advanced actions, bugs investigation & development of new features.

## Supported bytecode de-optimization methods
### oatdump (Default for API >= 24 or `--oatdump` flag)
Use oatdump host tool (`platform/art` project from AOSP) to extract DEX
bytecode from OAT's ELF `.rodata` section. Extracted DEX is not identical to
original since DEX-to-DEX compiler transformations have already been applied
when code was pre-optimized (more info
[here](https://github.com/anestisb/oatdump_plus#dex-to-dex-optimisations)).
[dexrepair](https://github.com/anestisb/dexRepair) is also used to repair the
extracted DEX file CRC checksum prior to appending bytecode back to matching
APK package from which it has been originally stripped. More info about this
method [here](https://github.com/anestisb/android-prepare-vendor/issues/22).

### baksmali / smali (`--smali` flag)
Use baksmali disassembler against target OAT file to generate a smali syntaxed
output. Disassembling process relies on boot framework files (which are
automatically include) to resolve class dependencies. Baksmali output is then
forwarded to smali assembler to generate a functionally equivalent DEX bytecode
file.

### SmaliEx *[DEPRECATED]* (Default for API-23 or `--smaliex` flag)
SmaliEx is an automation tool that is using baksmali/smali at the background and
is smoothly handling all the required disassembler/assembler iterations and
error handling. Unfortunately due to not quickly catching-up with upstream smali
& dexlib it has been deprecated for now.

## Configuration files explained
### Naked vs Full
Naked configuration group (enabled by default when using the master script)
includes data & module targets required to have a functional device from AOSP
without installing non-essential OEM packages. With this setup using Google Play
Services / Google Apps will probably not work.

On the other hand the full configuration group (enabled with `-f|--full` flag
from master script) has additional blobs & module targets which are normally
marked as non-essential, although might be required for some carriers or in case
of GApps being installed (either manually post-boot or included as additional
vendor blobs).

## Warnings
* No binary vendor data against supported devices will be maintained in this
repository. Scripts provide all necessary automation to generate them yourself.
* No promises on how the device configuration files will be maintained. Feel
free to contribute if you detect that something is broken, missing or not
required.
* Host tool binaries are provided for convenience, although with no promises
that will be kept up-to-date. Prefer to adjust your env. with upstream versions
and keep them updated.
* If you experience `already defined` type of errors when AOSP makefiles are
included, you have other vendor makefiles that define the same packages (e.g.
hammerhead vs bullhead for LGE vendor). This issue is due to other vendor
makefiles not wrapping them with `ifeq ($(TARGET_DEVICE),<device_model>)`.
Wrap conflicting makefiles with device matching clauses to resolve the issue.
* If Smali or SmaliEx de-optimization method is chosen, Java 8 is required for
the bytecode repair process to work.
* Bytecode repaired with oatdump method might not be able to be pre-optimized
when building AOSP. As such generated targets have `LOCAL_DEXPREOPT := false`.
This is because host dex2oat is invoked with more strict flags and results into
aborting when front-end reaches already optimized instructions. You can use
`--force-opt` flag if you have modified the default host dex2oat bytecode
pre-compilation flags.
* If you're planning to deliver OTA updates for Nexus 5x, you need to manually
extract `update-binary` from a factory OTA archive since it's missing from
the AOSP tree due to some proprietary LG code.
* Nexus 9 WiFi (volantis) & Nexus 9 LTE (volantisg) vendor blobs cannot co-exist
under same AOSP root directory. Since AOSP defines a single flounder target for
both boards, lots of definitions will conflict and create problems when building.
As such ensure that only one of them is present when building for desired
target. Generated makefiles include an additional defensive check that will
raise a compiler error when both are detected under same AOSP root.
* If tool output is not set to AOSP root directory, prefer `rsync` instead of
`cp` or `mv` commands to copy the generated directory structure to different
location. Some device configurations (e.g. Pixel/Pixel XL) share some root
directories and might break if `cp` or `mv` are invoked with the wrong base
paths.
